This extension provides a way to add SPARQL, SRU, and OAI-PMH support to TYPO3.
SRU (used as part of the Clarin federated content search) and OAI-PMH (used by
several other academic infrastructure providers) are organised via templates
with a few configuration options. SPARQL, in the other hand, requires existing
RDF serialisations and a running Oxigraph to add the data to. The extension
integrates with, but is not exclusively a part of the Cultural Heritage
Framework (CHF), a research software suite that helps you build web apps to
produce and publish data in the humanities. The CHF component CHF Container
includes a working Oxigraph set-up as used by this extension.
